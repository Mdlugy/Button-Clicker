# Button-Clicker
This was a project I built early on at Coding Dojo. 
The previous assigment was DojoPizza, a simple introduction to OOP. I took that project way too far. 

The assignment here was "build a button that does something." 
I couldn't let my dojoPizza code go to waste, so I built a simple web app that generates random pizzas with different weights for each possible quantity(up to 10) and likelihood of different toppings as well as weights for different cheese, sauce and crust types.
